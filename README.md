Simple node program to simulate a BINGO game. 
Make sure to install dependencies before running the script.
The game proceeds in rounds where numbers are drawn and will ask for some prompts to choose the number of players, show their bingo cards and ask for subsequent prompts in case an user thinks they've won.
Currently, only one user can attempt to win in each round.
